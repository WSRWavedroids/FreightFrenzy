/**
 * This file is our iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode" for TeleOp.
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When an selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is selected on the Robot Controller and executed.
 * This particular one is called "Lean Mean TeleOp Machine". I had a little too much fun with naming this.
 *
 * This OpMode controls the functions of the robot during the driver-controlled period.
 *
 * If the "@Disabled" line is not commented out, the program will not show up on the driver hub.
 * If you ever have problems with the program not showing up on the driver hub, it's probably because of that.
 *
 * Throughout this program, there are comments explaining what everything does because previous programmers
 * did a horrible job of doing that.
